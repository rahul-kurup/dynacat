# Installation

## Docker compose using provided directory structure (recommended)

Create a new directory called `dynacat` as well as the template files within it by running:

```bash
mkdir dynacat && cd dynacat && \
curl -sL https://github.com/Panonim/dynacat-compose-template/releases/latest/download/dynacat.tar.gz | tar -xzf -
```

<summary>Verifying the download</summary>

<br>
Every release ships a checksum next to the archive:

```bash
curl -sLO https://github.com/Panonim/dynacat-compose-template/releases/latest/download/dynacat.tar.gz
curl -sLO https://github.com/Panonim/dynacat-compose-template/releases/latest/download/dynacat.tar.gz.sha256
sha256sum -c dynacat.tar.gz.sha256
```
</details>

Then, edit the following files as desired:
* `docker-compose.yml` to configure the port, volumes and other containery things
* `config/home.yml` to configure the widgets or layout of the home page
* `config/dynacat.yml` if you want to change the theme or add more pages

### Other files you may want to edit

* `.env` to configure environment variables that will be available inside configuration files
* `assets/user.css` to add custom CSS

When ready, run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

If you encounter any issues, you can check the logs by running:

```bash
docker compose logs
```

## Docker compose manual

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following contents:

```yaml
services:
  dynacat:
    container_name: dynacat
    image: panonim/dynacat
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config
      - ./assets:/app/assets
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
      # Optionally, also mount docker socket if you want to use the docker containers widget
      # - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    env_file: .env
```

### Running as a non-root user

The image runs as root by default. Nothing in Dynacat needs it, and dropping to your own UID
and GID is recommended, especially if you mount the docker socket. The easiest way is to set
`PUID` and `PGID`:

```yaml
services:
  dynacat:
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
```

On startup the container hands `config`, `assets` and its image cache over to that UID and GID,
then runs Dynacat as that user. Only the owner is changed, the permission bits of your files are
left as they are and symlinks are never followed. If the docker socket is mounted, the user is
added to the group that owns it. `PGID` defaults to `PUID` when left out.

#### Using `user` instead

If you would rather the container never start as root, use `user` instead of `PUID`/`PGID`:

```yaml
services:
  dynacat:
    user: "1000:1000"
```

The container cannot fix ownership in this mode, so two things have to line up yourself:

- `config` and `assets` have to be readable and writable by that user, otherwise the UI editor
  cannot save and the dynawidgets cache cannot be written: `chown -R 1000:1000 config assets`.
- `/app` itself stays owned by root, so the image cache has to be moved onto a mounted volume
  by setting `cache-dir` in your `dynacat.yml`:

```yaml
server:
  cache-dir: /app/assets/.cache
```

If you mount the docker socket for the docker widgets, the user also has to be in the group
that owns it, which is normally `docker`. When a folder is not writable, Dynacat logs a warning
on startup with the exact `chown` command to run.

Then, create a new directories called `config` & `assets` and download the example starting [`dynacat.yml`](https://github.com/Panonim/dynacat/blob/main/docs/docs/dynacat.yml) file into it by running:

```bash
mkdir config && wget -O config/dynacat.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Panonim/dynacat/refs/heads/main/docs/docs/dynacat.yml
```

Feel free to edit the `dynacat.yml` file to your liking, or leave it as is and use the [UI editor](ui-editor.md) once the container is up. When ready run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

If you encounter any issues, you can check the logs by running:

```bash
docker logs dynacat
```

## Coming from Glance

If you have already set up glance you're only one step away from switching to Dynacat!

All you have to do is replace your current image (`glanceapp/glance:latest`) with one from below:

```yaml
panonim/dynacat:latest
```

<details>
<summary>I get the following error: dynacat.yml: no such file or directory</summary>

<br>
Make sure to rename your `glance.yml` file into `dynacat.yml`.
</details>

### Disable automatic updates

| Variable | Default | Description |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `ENABLE_DYNAMIC_UPDATE` | `true` | Set to `false`, `0`, or `f` to disable automatic widget refresh. Useful for static views or default glance behaviour. |


## Build binary with Go

Requirements: [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) >= v1.23

To build the project for your current OS and architecture, run:

```bash
mkdir -p build && go build -o build/dynacat .
```

To build for a specific OS and architecture, run:

```bash
mkdir -p build && GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o build/dynacat .
```

[*click here for a full list of GOOS and GOARCH combinations*](https://go.dev/doc/install/source#:~:text=$GOOS%20and%20$GOARCH)

Alternatively, if you just want to run the app without creating a binary, like when you're testing out changes, you can run:

```bash
go run .
```
